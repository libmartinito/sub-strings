# Substrings

This is a solution to the sub strings problem.

## Overview

### The challenge

A method called substrings should be implemented that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valud substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found. The method should also be able to handle multiple words.

## My Process

### Built with

- Ruby

### What I Learned

I learned about the syntax of loops, conditionals, arrays, and hashes in Ruby.

### Continued development

I am interested in developing a front end for this piece of logic with new tools and frameworks as I learn them.

### Useful resources

- [Array documentation of Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.3/Array.html)
